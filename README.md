# ShellSort_College

This is the Shell Sort that I learned in college. It did me well for 30 years.

Taking the number of elements and dividing it by two, gives you the first gap. Then you cycle through the array, sorting from lowest to highest. When you are done sorting using that gap, divide the gap by 2, and start over. When the gap becomes zero, you're through.
